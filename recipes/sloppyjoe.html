    <p>Delicious chorizo sloppy joe that will have you craving for more. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 pounds  bulk fresh Mexican chorizo</li>
        <li>1 (8-ounce) package red chile enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>4 sesame seed hamburger buns, split and toasted</li>
        <li>1 large avocado, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup corn chips, roughly crushed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the chorizo:
Starting in a cold nonstick skillet, cook the chorizo over medium heat, stirring often with a wooden spoon to break the meat into smaller pieces, until cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes. 

Transfer the chorizo to a medium bowl using a slotted spoon. Remove the drippings from the skillet; discard or reserve for another use. Add the enchilada sauce and water; bring to a boil over medium-high. 

Continue to cook over medium-high, stirring often, until the sauce is just slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in the reserved browned chorizo; cook, stirring frequently, until heated through, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove from heat.</li>

        <li>Assemble the sloppy Joes:
Divide the chorizo mixture evenly among 4 bottom buns. Top evenly with corn chips, sliced avocado, and the remaining bun tops. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
